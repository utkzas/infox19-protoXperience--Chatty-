Simple UI of a website that rewards whenever you work for a social cause :-)

We, Utkarsh Sharma and [Chaitanya Chopra](www.instagram.com/chatty.chopra) created a UI in Infoexpressions, USICT held on 12-10-19. The theme was to design an UI (frontend only)
# Overview
A real-life reward system which helps the user to win rewards in real life for some tasks they perform for the community. Users can help others with various tasks which are required for an area or a group of people and in return receive rewards that are actually helpful to them. These tasks will focus on contributions to the community and help build a shared well-being.

The project was created using Pure HTML and CSS. No template was used , designs made by us
